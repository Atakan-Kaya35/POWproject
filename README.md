A simulation project that simulates the world where an app for a medication delivery system is present. The map simulates Bilkent University with patients at key location of the campus,
in need of a their medication!

Present Features:
- A dynammic traffic logic where the traffic in the map's roads change throughout a the day in the simulation.
- A* algorithm that finds the fastest route accounting for the dynamic traffic and avoiding obstacles.
- User interfaces for both users and couriers to use, containing current delivery status and shopping page.
- A MySQL database that keeps track of user data and current orders to synch the simulation through devices.
- Different classes of couriers capable of delivering different sets of medicine.
- Busy hour logic where there is more demand for medicine and more traffic on average.
